        <h1>What are the Knights of Columbus?</h1>
        <p>
          The Knights of Columbus is a Catholic Fraternal Organization created
          to serve families, parishes, community and the Catholic Church. <br />
          The first Knights of Columbus were started in 1882 in New Haven, CT by
          Fr. Michael McGivney. At the time, Catholics could not get life
          insurance, and as most of the men/breadwinners worked in dangerous
          hard labor jobs, many families would be left without money to support
          them if the husband died. After the father's death, the families would
          be torn apart and the children would be fostered by other families who
          most likely weren't Catholic and wouldn't raise the children in their
          family's faith. <br />
          McGivney and his first knights banded together and started a small
          fund to give to those who need support after the loss of the husband.
          They also started providing community and parish support in many
          different ways.
          <br />
          Since that time, the Order has grown from nine men in one local
          council to over two million men in over 16,000 councils and 19
          countries, including Canada, France, The Philippines, Mexico, Poland,
          The Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Panama, The Bahamas, The Virgin
          Islands, Cuba, Guatemala, Guam, Saipan, Lithuania, Ukraine, South
          Korea.<br />

        <h1>Who are the Knights of Columbus?</h1>
        <p>
          The Knights of Columbus are practicing Catholic men who are 18 years
          and older. In your local council, they are men you see every day at
          mass and events. They are fathers, sons, and men who love their
          families and parish. The knights and their families volunteer their
          time, talent and "treasure" to raise funds to serve their parish and
          community. Beside our Catholic faith, the knights follow four tenets:
          Charity, Unity, Fraternity, and Patriotism.

        <h1>What is Our Lady of the Angels Council #15857?</h1>
        <p>
          Our Lady of the Angels Council #15857 is the local council serving
          Guardian Angels parish in Mead, CO. The council was officially formed
          on December 10, 2013 by 43 men, including their then pastor, Fr. Alan
          Hartway CPPS. Many of these men, and more who have joined, serve their
          parish on parish councils or as deacons. Others serve in ministries as
          lectors, extra-ordinary ministers, and more. Many serve in the council
          helping in many of the different programs the council conducts, and
          serve as prayer warriors. <br />
          The council has officers who serve as the leadership team, equivalent
          to a board of directors. The officer positions are below. Grand Knight
          Deputy Grand Knight Chancellor Chaplain Treasurer Advocate Recorder
          Warden Inside Guard Outside Guard Trustees Financial Secretary Most of
          these positions are elected yearly, and serve in two (2) consecutive
          terms. There are also directors who supervise and/or run programs or
          areas of service (e.g. Life, Community, Family, Faith).<br />

        <h1>What does the Council #15857 do?</h1>
        <p>
          The Knights of Council #15857 are active in many ways. Some are more
          visible, while others may not be. Some of the most visible ways that
          the council serves are in the monthly breakfast burrito sales, canned
          food drives, annual Red Hidden Peach sales and sweet corn sales, and
          hosting the monthly parish Game Night and Movie Night. You'll almost
          always find knights helping set up and put away tables and chairs for
          parish events, as well as the canopy tent on the McGivney Terrace, on
          the south side of the parish. They will also cook food for parish
          picnics and other events. There are many ways the council serves that
          may not be seen. The council uses funds raised through events like
          peaches and sweet corn sales to support: Coats for Kids (winter coats
          for local kids that need one) Unbound (support for a young child,
          currently located in Madagascar) Seminarians and Diaconate candidates
          Canned Food Drive for local food banks Rosaries for funerals Pregnancy
          Support Centers March for Life and more!

        <h1>
          How do I support the Knights of Columbus? How do I join the Knights?
        </h1>
        <p>
          You are probably already supporting the Knights. If you buy breakfast
          burritos, peaches, or sweet corn, you are helping support our causes!
          Join us for one of our events. We would love to see many more people
          playing games at Game Night or enjoying popcorn and a movie at Movie
          Night. All of these are ways to support the knights. We are so happy
          to hear you want to join the knights! There are two ways to join the
          knights. 1. Go to www.kofc.org and click on "Join". This will take a
          few minutes but is the fastest and easiest method. Make sure you put
          our council number, 15857 in. There is a code on the page to even get
          your first year membership free! Once you complete the registration,
          you are already a knight! If we haven't already been talking with you,
          we will get in contact with you to help you join the council more. 2.
          Fill out a Form 100 that you can get from many of the knights or
          download here, and give to a knight or even turn in to the parish
          office. Someone will contact you to help you finish becoming a knight.
          Whether you join the knights online or with a Form 100, you will go
          through a small ceremony to explain our tenets of Charity, Unity and
          Fraternity. Your family is invited and welcome to watch the ceremony
          with you. This can also be watched/attended online if scheduling is an
          issue.

      <section id="what-do-i-have-to-do-as-a-knight">
        <h1>What do I have to do as a knight? What am I required to do?</h1>
        <p>
          Once you are a knight, there is no requirement of how much or how
          little you need to participate in council events. The only real
          "requirement" is paying the annual council dues, and if you have
          financial issues that make that hard, talk to the officers; we can
          help! We recommend to all our knights the same thing if they aren't
          sure of what to do as a knight. Help with one thing, once a year.
          There are many programs that can use knights doing small things. When
          we hold a canned food drive, help hand out the "shopping list" and
          bags after the mass you already attend. Help sell burritos or sweet
          corn or peaches, again after the mass you are already at! These
          services take fifteen minutes or less of your day and don't require
          you to make an extra trip anywhere. Want a real stress-free way to
          participate? Join at a game night or movie night! What do you have to
          do? Play games or watch a movie! Buy a FundCrazr ticket (or more than
          one). As a council member, you'll receive emails about upcoming and
          ongoing events. If you see one that interests you, sign up and
          participate. Do you think you have a skill that could help (are you
          good with numbers and financials? Think you can help get more men
          interested in the Knights? Are you passionate about a program or area
          we already help in?) and want to serve the council in that way? Talk
          to an officer at the meeting. Is there something you would like to see
          the knights participate in or help with? Talk to the council at a
          meeting. We are always interested in new ways we can help. Any man
          that joins is a candidate to be an officer in the council. Men like
          you are qualified to be an officer and help the council. No man is
          "not good enough" to be an officer. No matter how you find a way to
          serve, we are happy to see you.
